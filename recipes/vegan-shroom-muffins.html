        <h2> The Thing about it is...</h2>
        <p>There is nothing as good as a real bacon and cheese muffin!</p>
        <p>But, for our vegan and fasting Orthodox friends, we need to provide a nice substitute for them so they can enjoy the very things we all like!</p>
        <br>
        <h3> The Inners of this Thingy: </h3>
        <p>Your are going to need the following items to make this magical thing;</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Place a large frying pan over a high heat & add a little olive oil, when the pan is hot add the mushrooms & sauté for 4 minutes. When they are golden stir through the paprika, garlic, salt, soy sauce & agave nectar. Cook for a couple minutes then remove them from the pan.</li>
