        <h2> The Thing about it is...</h2>
        <p>There is nothing as good as a real Hot Dog!</p>
        <p>But, for our vegan and fasting Orthodox friends, we need to provide a nice substitute for them so they can enjoy the very things we all like!</p>
        <br>
        <h3> The Inners of this Thingy: </h3>
        <p>Your are going to need the following items to make this magical thing;</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 tbs Olive Oil </li>
            <li> 1/2 an Onion, Chopped Small </li>
            <li> 2 Clove of Garlic, Minced </li>
            <li> 2 Portobello Mushrooms, Chopped Small </li>
            <li> 100g Walnuts </li>
            <li> 1 Pouch Merchant Gourmet Puy Lentils </li>
            <li> 100g Cooked Sweet Potato </li>
            <li> 1 tbs Chipotle Paste </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp Sweet Smoked Paprika </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp Dried Oregano</li>
            <li> 2 tbs Tomato Purée </li>
            <li> 1 tbs Balsamic Vinegar </li>
            <li> 5 tbs Heaped Plain Flour </li>
            <li> 25g Dried Breadcrumbs </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp Cracked Black Pepper </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp Sea Salt </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> The Method: </h3>
        <p> This is how we are going to put the whole damn thing together; </p>
        <ol>
            <li> First up sauté the onion, garlic & mushrooms over a medium heat in a little olive oil until golden, be sure to make sure all the liquid has evaporated from the mushrooms. Once sautéed, transfer the mix from the pan to a bowl. </li> 
            <li> Add the walnuts to your food processor & blitz them to a crumb. Next add the lentils & sweet potato to the food processor, pulse 2-3 times to lightly break up the potato & lentils.</li>
            <li> Add the walnuts, potato & lentils to the bowl with the mushrooms, onion & garlic, followed by all the remaining sausage ingredients then mix well with a spatula. The sausage mix should be relatively dry but if your mixture feels too wet, add a little more flour or breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li> Lightly flour your hands then form the mixture into around 8-10 sausages.</li>
            <li> The sausages are now ready to be cooked on your bbq, or alternatively in a non stick frying pan or oven.</li>
            <li> For bbq cooking, I recommend cooking the sausage over hot coals rather than a naked flame, make sure your grill is clean and greased well with a little oil. Grill the sausages for 7-8 minutes turning them carefully every now and then.</li>
            <li> Alternatively for cooking them in a pan, pre heat your non stick frying pan over a medium heat and sauté the sausages for 8-10 minutes, turning them over every now and then.</li>
            <li> I serve my hot dogs topped with all my favourite trimmings such as, finely chopped onion & pepper, crispy onion, mustard and ketchup.</li>
            <li> The sausages can be pre made and stored in your fridge for up to 2-3 days before cooking.</li>
        </ol>
