        <h2> The Thing about it is...</h2>
        <p>There is nothing as good as a real Eggs Benedict!</p>
        <p>But, for our vegan and fasting Orthodox friends, we need to provide a nice substitute for them so they can enjoy the very things we all like!</p>
        <br>
        <h3> The Inners of this Thingy: </h3>
        <p>Your are going to need the following items to make this magical thing;</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 Block (225g) Extra Firm Smoked Tofu, pressed to remove water, I used (tofoo brand) </li>
            <li> 2 tbs Cooking Oil, for frying </li>
            <li> Pinch Black Salt (optional for an "eggy" flavour, if not use sea salt) </li>
            <li> Pinch Ground Pepper </li>
            <h5> Hollandaise Sauce </h5>
            <li> 1/2 cup/120ml Soy Milk (this recipe will only work with soy milk) </li>
            <li> 3 tbs White Wine Vinegar </li>
            <li> 1/2 cup/120ml Yellow Rapeseed Oil </li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp English Mustard </li>
            <li> Pinch Sea Salt & Ground Pepper </li>
            <h5> Sautéed Spinach </h5>
            <li> 4 Big Handfuls of Baby Spinach & Pinch Seasoning</li>
            <h5> Serve with: </h5>
            <li> 2 toasted breakfast muffins, small bunch of fresh chives, chopped fine, pinch of cress, a handful of cherry tomatoes halved </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> The Method: </h3>
        <p> This is how we are going to put the whole damn thing together; </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First up make the Hollandaise, in a measuring jug add the soy milk, vinegar, seasoning & mustard. Using an electric hand/stick blender, blend until mixed well.</li> 
            <li>Whilst blending slowly trickle in the oil until the sauce starts to thicken up. Once you’ve added all the oil it should be thick & creamy, but still pourable.</li>
            <li>If your sauce is too thick stir in a few additional tablespoons of soy milk. Check for seasoning. </li>
            <li>Cover the sauce with cling film & set aside until you’re ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Cut the tofu into rectangles, around 4mm thick. Pat dry with kitchen paper then preheat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to the pan, followed by the tofu. Pan fry until golden on each side, this should take 3-4 minutes. Season with the black salt if using & pepper.</li>
            <li>Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside, turn the heat up high a touch more oil & when it starts to smoke & all the spinach (don’t worry it will wilt down quickly).</li>
            <li>Cook the spinach for 1 minute, stirring quickly. Season with a pinch of salt & pepper then removes from the heat.</li> 
            <li>The spinach will contain lots of water so I always press it with a clean kitchen towel to soak up excess liquid.</li>
            <li> Serve everything on top of toasted bagels, then sprinkle over some chopped chives. Serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
